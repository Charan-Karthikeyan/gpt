I have observed some strange problems in linux machines.
These problems don't occur in my SUN. I think that they
are due to bad float conversion/arithmetic. I don't know
who is responsible: myself, the compiler, or the OS.
Since I don't have a linux box, I don't expect to fix
this in the near future.
