The Hector Levesque Omelette's problem.
There are three variations of the problem: an unfavorable
one in which the probability of a good egg is .25,
a fair one with probability .5 of good/bad egg, and
a very favorable one with probability .95 of good egg.
Interestingly, the first two has identical optimal
policies different to the policy for the last variation.
